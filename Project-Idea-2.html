purpose of our project idea and also the underlying message that we want to
convey to our potential customers is that you can indeed learn new things just
by participating in a fun activity without any form of consequences. Moreover,
we are trying to promote interactive education through our free platform and
hopefully spark the interest of young people to always seek out new knowledge.
Having defined the end goal of this assignment, the primary deliverables our
team are going for include an operational version of “The Ultimate Trivia Game”
loaded with approximately 150-200 questions from a variety of genres. When a
user launches our game on their devices, there should be a home page (with an
accompanying theme song if possible) with a start button in the middle and the
game title “The Ultimate Trivia Game” on top, a control panel containing
buttons (sounds button, music button, high scores button, home button)
displaying on the right-hand corner of the screen. 
&nbsp; The moment the player clicks “Start” which
happens to be our logo, they will be redirected to a page where the rules of
the game are explained in clear detail. Once they have mastered the rules, just
click the “Continue” button below the text box to move on to the actual
gameplay and questions. A question page typically has a large text box
centralized in the screen containing the prompt, and four rectangular boxes
each showing a possible answer. Choose the right option, and you will be
awarded with points and proceed to the following question. Otherwise, a message
will pop up revealing the correct choice and will deduct points from your
total. Your overall score will be announced at the end of a round and saved
into the high scores table. If all of the goals and outcomes are accurately
met, then it can be concluded that this project was a rousing success that can
be publicly released for our targeted demographics to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">&nbsp; As a disclaimer, “The Ultimate Trivia Game”
does not support some online features such as live competitions, real-life
rewards, global leaderboards, trivia races or anything of that sort.
Additionally, this game will only be available in single player mode for the
time being as stated in the previous sections. Because having multiple players
in the same game would be too complicated to pull off, this will be categorized
as beyond the scope of our project. Lastly, our trivia game will not offer in-app
purchases for tokens or power-ups of any kind, as it would violate our initial
purpose of a pure test of knowledge with only three lifelines to guide you
through the questions instead of more fancy add-ins components. Most of the
features we decided to opt out from our game is due to personal preferences and
to a lesser extent, time constraints of this assignment. This is still our
first semester as IT students, so we needed to set boundaries of what should be
incorporated instead of being too ambitous and coming up short in the end.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-1">On
account of the simplicity of our project idea, the software requirements that
we need are completely accessible and is free of charge for the most part. To
compile our team report, Microsoft Word alone is sufficient because it has all
the tools and technologies particularly for writing, and because we all have
the official license and years of experience so there is virtually no other
suitable alternative. For our website, we will be using Visual Studio Code to
program every aspect of it as well as pushing the finished code to our online
repository via Git. We chose this software because it is cost-free and we are
all quite familiar with how to use VS Code thanks to the tutorial sessions we
attended. Last but not least, our group will be constructing “The Ultimate
Trivia Game” using the Trivia Maker platform, and we even purchased the premium
version for an affordable 6.99$ to gain access to all features unlimited. Out
of all the tools we are incorporating, Trivia Maker is the only platform where
none of us have previously experimented with. However, this minor detail would
not affect us too much because this platform is well-documented with
comprehensive tutorials to help us navigate through all the functions of this
website in a matter of minutes. In essence, our group will be making this game
on the foundation of the technologies we are accustomed to in class, which
decreases the time spent on understanding the tools we need to use and prevents
us from being distracted from our other objectives.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">This is
one of the most exciting procedures of any project and yet is one of the most
terrifying, simply because it will determine whether our working efforts were
fruitful or were they in vain. If the product we created passed these tests
with flying colors, this means that we are heading on the right track and our
game is performing astoundingly on all cylinders. On the other hand, if our
tests return imperfections, then we would immediately look for those errors to
eliminate them right away. Our group intend to test our game out after every
input session, which means that everytime we finished a brand-new feature we
would run the game from the beginning up to our most recent modification to
check for inaccuracies and resolve them (if any). This area will be named
“Alpha Testing”, where we as the developers try out all aspects concerning our
game before the official release to the public. 
&nbsp; After our product has passed the “Alpha
Testing” period, we will proceed with the “Beta Testing” process where our team
will search for random participants to try out the first version of “The
Ultimate Trivia Maker” and in turn, they will give us their comments and
feedback on their overall experience, as well as provide us with
suggestions/recommendations for enhancement. We will probably need a sample
size of around 10-20 people including our IT friends, lecturers (if possible)
and also non-IT friends to receive as transparent and objective opinions as
possible. It is crucial for this “Beta Testing” stage to be as randomized as
possible, since these peer reviews of the game will greatly serve us in terms
of bug fixes and optimizations in preparation for future updates. Therefore, we
need to invite students and faculty members from different areas of expertise
to play our game for a wider exposure to many demographics, consequently
receiving more generalized and multi-dimensional perspectives.</p>

our team intended on creating a typical hand-made table representing our
working schedule for the present and in the following weeks using Word’s Insert
Table function, but after consulting several senior students at RMIT and also
some of our IT friends, we discovered a much more organized and productive way
to illustrate our timeframe that happens to be the “Gantt Charts”. Using a free
and fully customizable template from Microsoft, the only thing we were required
to do was to download the desired template and opening it via Microsofr Excel
where we can modify and adjust the chart to our own preferences. Once we are
satisfied with the final results, we just need to screenshot our Gantt Chart
then paste it into our report, an incredibly simple and useful method to map
out your entire plan.

with Microsoft Gantt Charts:</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2">Conducting
a large-scale project such as this means that we need to conscious of certain
risks and threats towards the eventual success of this assignment. Once our
group has made ourselves aware of these imminent problems, we need to devise
proper counter-measures to prevent them from affecting our collective
performance. Since our topic choice involves developing a trivia game, there
are quite a few technical risks that comes to our attention, especially when
each individual has reasonable experience with the current gaming market. Some threats
include fatal crashes or errors that make a game severely malfunction,
inaccuracies in the information provided (outdated data, wrong statistics, bad
questions), insufficient time to complete the basic mechanism, software and
hardware issues (system failure, old version, lack of supporting documents,
computer crashes, data loss). After a long period of brainstorming, these were
several liabilities we could come up with that may happen during the developing
process, but it can be assumed that more may arise unexpectedl and beyond our
control. Apart from the technological aspect, we should also prepare for more
general risks such as poor team communication, delay in tasks, conflicts or
unwanted incidents from any of the team members. To sum up, we have assessed
and anticipated various issues that could hinder our progress to the best of
our knowledge and will look out for them during our working period and the
whole team will be cautious in conducting this project for guaranteed success.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">&nbsp; A group cannot operate adequately without strong communication between
members and every decision must be made unanimously under the approval of each
member. Thankfully, the introduction of social media platforms like Facebook,
Discord, Gmail, Zalo or Skype has provided us with much more convenience in
organizing virtual meetings regardless of location or time, as opposed to just
the traditional face-to-face meetings. Nevertheless, physical meetings are
still our preferable style of team meeting, so we would make every opportunity
to host at least one face-to-face meeting per week. If this option cannot be
done, then social media is a viable solution, and we can easily exchange
documents and ideas by chatting on Messenger/Discord or uploading files to our
shared Github or Gmail account. Moreover, we could even arrange video calls
every weekend to have more interaction and for each person to have a chance to
discuss their progress with the rest of the team. Because our group appreciates
close-knit teamwork and always try to promote communication, we all expect each
other to actively share their thoughts and opinions in the chats on a daily
basis so that we can stay connected and possibly learn new things about each
other. As a result, our productivity will increase exponentially which in turn
will lead to desirable outcomes. We all have discipline as individuals so
working together means mutual respect for one another and quick responses to
team announcements. Should a team member show laziness in this aspect, we would
definitely try to solve this conflict amongst ourselves first and only when
things spiral out of hand will we take this problem to our lecturer for his
final decision.</p>
